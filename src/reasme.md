 Ipsum nice simply the filler tex 
for printers and text files.  Ipsum has been
the standard filler text of industries since the
1500s, when an unknown printer used a gallery of 
texts and mixed them in
such a way that he managed to make a specimen 
textbook. Not only did it survive 500 years, but it 
also entered as filler text
in electronic documents,
remaining essentially the same as the original. It 
was popularized in the 60s with the creation of the 
"Letraset" sheets, which contained passages from 
 Ipsum, and
more recently with desktop publishing software, such 
as Aldus PageMaker, which includes versions of  
Ipsum.
